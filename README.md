Hey There! I see you are looking at the source and wanted to warn/inform you of a few things:

First off, as usual you are looking at a piece that is more artistic than technical,
I have no idea what I am doing ( especially in the HTML / CSS ) so please forgive any
hilarious oversights.

Second off, if you are wondering 'how in the heck does this work', Check out the 
library I created for doing physics based gpu programming in the web over at:

http://cabbi.bo/PhysicsRenderer/

There are also a few other pieces of code I think are pretty usuable such as

ShaderLoader ( http://cabbi.bo/ShaderLoader/ )
Looper
LoadedAudio

Other than that, you will be digging into a little bit of code that is like the 
original sketch that gets painted over and hidden forever. That being said, if 
you want to know more *please* reach out to me on twitter.

I love you and thanks for stopping by!
